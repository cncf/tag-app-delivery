00:13:23	Roberth Strand:	Sorry, hosting webinars back-to-back is hard to get the timing right of
00:13:47	Scott - CNCF GitOps Working Group:	Robert very understood! Especially this week 😅
00:14:08	Roberth Strand:	Constant things going on.

00:19:10	Leonardo Murillo:	i'd like clarity as to where the human/machine component would go in the principle
00:33:57	Leonardo Murillo:	Roberth 💓 for book recommendation!
00:34:43	Roberth Strand:	The little book of GitOps
00:35:39	Roberth Strand:	#4 looks great now
00:45:59	Brice Fernandes:	Continuous in the context of Software operations is established and I feel mostly aligns with our intent as currently understood.
00:46:50	Brice Fernandes:	Removing continuous would lose the explicit rejection of batch processes.
00:46:50	Moshe Immerman:	the dictionary definition is without interruption
00:47:05	Brice Fernandes:	Loop and continuous are synonymous for me.
00:47:52	Christian:	ständig vs Sofort
00:48:20	Brice Fernandes:	Without interruption _is_ what we mean, I think. Isn’t it? We’re reconciling state between desired and actual without interruption
00:49:13	Roberth Strand:	Merriam-Webster never use the word instantly in their definition.
00:49:16	Roberth Strand:	For instance
00:52:09	Leonardo Murillo:	yeah I don't agree with continuous being synonymous nor inclusive of instantaneity
00:53:00	Christian:	how do you define loop without using continuous?
00:53:15	Roberth Strand:	There are no loop without continuous
00:53:18	Christian:	+1 to Bryce
00:53:29	Roberth Strand:	I agree with Bryce
00:58:20	Roberth Strand:	+1 Scott
00:59:51	Brice Fernandes:	Re Governance, I agree that this is an extremely important topic. We currently only specify only a subset of rule that a state store and desired state changes must comply with (Principle #2). That said, committing straight to master is perfectly acceptable in some contexts.
01:00:30	Brice Fernandes:	Best practices of gitops sounds like a good place to develop governance +1 Chris
01:00:38	Christian:	that sounds like an implementation detail vs principal
01:01:16	Leonardo Murillo:	agreed with these concepts as very relevant in terms of best practices, not a component of the principles
01:01:32	Leonardo Murillo:	need to drop, happy to see consensus on the 4 principles, great work team!
01:01:40	Cornelia Davis:	Have to run. Thanks all.
01:03:20	Chris Sanders:	I have to drop as well.  Thanks for the discussion.  Looking good!
01:04:12	Christian:	I think the other principals should be expanded to include governance
01:04:17	Roberth Strand:	Brice are a mindreader, I guess
01:04:18	Brice Fernandes:	Governance will look so different based on the context. Practices aren’t universally applicable. Principles are. Governance is practice
01:04:47	Christian:	great conversation! gtg
01:06:18	Brice Fernandes:	“How GitOps enables Governance” Seems like an excellent explanatory note.
01:08:25	Roberth Strand:	Sounds like a plan
