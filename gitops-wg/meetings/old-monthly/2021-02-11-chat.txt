00:25:58	Waldemar:	What are the requirements for the co-chairs and is it suitable new people to this working group?
00:28:16	Waldemar:	Alright thanks!
00:30:14	Waldemar:	Makes perfectly sense, thanks.
00:30:55	Cornelia Davis:	I’m still here. Just going to get my tea :-)

00:46:31	Schlomo Schapiro:	Since I don't know about the previous discussion I don't understand what's the problem with calling it "GitOps Principles" or who objects to that term.
00:46:52	Schlomo Schapiro:	Like, GitOps Principles sounds perfectly appropriate to me :-)

01:04:23	Dan Garfield:	Thanks Crhis
01:04:26	Dan Garfield:	Chris*
01:05:10	Scott Rigby:	Moshe, I love the idea of dogfooding. However, moving all our discussions to just within git is a very cumbersome way to actually discuss things. For example we can’t zoom in git either. But when the discussion is answered we can commit it to git
01:05:55	Toni Menzel:	zoom in git.. good point ;)
01:06:03	Chris Sanders:	Git = single source of truth :-)
01:06:28	Waldemar:	Well said Brice. i agree.
01:07:47	Brice Fernandes:	Worth noting is that we’re not really operating software as a working group.
01:09:48	Scott Rigby:	Brice yes, and nothing to automatically “reconcile”
01:09:51	Scott Rigby:	Bye!
