        Welcome to TAG App Delivery's **infrastructure for apps** use case survey.
        
        TAG App Delivery wants to understand developers' use cases for supporting infrastructure services in cloud-native applications.
        Please share details about the services your cloud-native apps require, how they are delivered and updated, pains you encounter and suggestions for improvement.

        Thank you for your contributions!
