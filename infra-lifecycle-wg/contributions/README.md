# Contributions

This subdirectory contains contributions to the Infrastructure Lifecycle Working Group. Here, you’ll find markdown files that focus on various Infrastructure as Code (IaC) related topics. These documents are opinionated and reflect the community’s collective input, driven by cloud-native principles.

The contributions are created by the community to provide a shared understanding of best practices, patterns, and challenges in the IaC space. They are intentionally written with an emphasis on practical guidance and real-world applicability.

Once the CNCF reorganization is complete, we aim to repurpose these documents into different forms of content, such as a whitepaper, blog posts, and other materials under the TAG Infrastructure - Infrastructure as Code group. This will help ensure that the community’s insights continue to shape and influence the broader cloud-native ecosystem.
