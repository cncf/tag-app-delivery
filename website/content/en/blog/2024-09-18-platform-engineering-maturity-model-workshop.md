As organizations navigate the complexities of modern technology infrastructure, **platform engineering** has emerged as a critical discipline for driving efficiency and scalability. With the [**Platform Engineering Maturity Model (PEMM)**](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/) being a relatively new concept, leveraging it effectively positions practitioners at the forefront of industry innovation. At the same time, our community continues to develop best practices for linking PEMM concepts to business value. Connecting our investment into PEMM methodology with clear business value is critical for buy-in with decision makers.

In this case study, I'll demonstrate how I used the PEMM as tool to unify multiple teams following an internal restructuring at Red Hat. I'll demonstrate additional potential for the Platform Engineering Maturity Model (PEMM) to add value, connect teams, and align leadership with common terminology and goals.

## Workshop 

### Objectives

* **Align Leadership with Platform Goals**: Secure buy-in from decision-makers for adopting the `platform-as-a-product` mindset and implementing PEMM within Red Hat.
* **Unify Diverse Teams**: Bring together platform teams under a common framework to enhance collaboration and streamline efforts post-restructuring.
* **Establish a Shared Vocabulary**: Develop a common language among teams to improve communication and understanding of platform engineering practices.

### Highlights

**Context**: Following an internal restructuring at Red Hat, there was a need to align newly co-located platform teams and ensure that leadership was on board with industry trends, best practices, and termninology.

**Duration**: A focused, one-hour interactive session, designed for maximum impact.

**Preparation**: Teams independently assessed their maturity levels using a 1-4 scale, documenting their insights in a shared [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_ZoX89ScG0m10VxT5p7wwLlHMnVEv6RmrygvSLsnh4/edit?usp=sharing) prior to the workshop. This self-assessment aimed to foster genuine reflection and prepare teams for in-depth discussions.

**Ranking System**: I chose to use a numeric scale for ranking, as opposed to the headline text for each level in the PEMM. This small change brought simplicity and effectiveness in facilitating meaningful dialogue, and was especially beneficial for participants new to the PEMM concept.

### Key Strategies

#### Independent Self-Assessment

By encouraging teams to self-evaluate their maturity levels, I enabled engagement and cross-team understanding, rather than enforcing strict adherence to PEMM criteria.

#### Collaborative and Inclsuive Format

During the workshop, team leaders presented their PEMM rankings and provided context and reasoning for their assesment. Teams were called on individually for each PEMM category, giving all participants a voice and room to be heard. This approach promoted transparency and built trust across teams. This strategy avoided a drawn-out review of all five categories at once, allowing for focused discussion and feedback.

##### Interactive Dialogue

An open Q&A session after each PEMM ranking presentaion allowed participants to exchange ideas, ask probing questions, and offer constructive feedback, fostering a collaborative environment.

### Outcomes

* **Accelerated Value Delivery**: I enabled efficient implementation of platform initiatives and effective communication with stakeholders by unifying platform teams under the PEMM framework.
* **Leadership Alignment**: I secured buy-in from decision-makers, aligning them with our platform engineering objectives and communicating the value of the `platform-as-a-product` approach. 
* **Enhanced Collaboration**: We established a shared vocabulary and understanding among teams, breaking down silos and promoting synergy in our post-restructuring operations.
* **Educational Impact**: We successfully introduced PEMM concepts to team members unfamiliar with the framework, expanding our organization's collective expertise in the cutting-edge aspects of platform engineering.

## Next Steps

Building on the workshop's success, I conducted a follow-up session focused on **platform user personas**. This session aimed to deepen our understanding of user needs and align our platform capabilities accordingly, further accelerating value delivery and solidifying `platform-as-a-product` mindset with key stakeholders.

I will be writing a follow-up blog on the **PEMM User Personas Workshop** to share insights and outcomes from this session, with associated templates and resources for the community.

## Conclusion

This case study illustrates the significant impact that embracing new frameworks like PEMM can have on an organization. By applying PEMM during a critical restructuring phase, I not only aligned our platform teams and leadership but also positioned internal Red Hat teams at the forefront of platform engineering thought and practice. The workshop demonstrates how organizations can utilize the Platform Engineering Maturity Model to drive change, new approaches, and innovation in their platform engineering practices.
