As the cloud native landscape matures, developer productivity remains one of the most critical — yet often overlooked — pillars of successful adoption. Despite widespread investment in modern platforms, microservices, and continuous delivery pipelines, many organizations still experience friction that slows down delivery and frustrates teams.

This article is based on a lightning talk delivered at the TAG App Delivery booth during KubeCon EU 2025. It introduces a foundational framework intended to spark a broader conversation around what it takes to truly improve Developer Experience (DevX) in cloud native environments. While initially developed as an individual effort, the framework is now being shared with the community as a basis for collective exploration and refinement.

## Expanding the View on Developer Experience

Developer Experience (DevX) is often narrowly defined as the interface between developers and the platform. But in the context of cloud native software delivery, DevX spans far more than that. It encompasses the **entire development lifecycle** — from local implementation and testing to deployment, production monitoring, and continuous feedback.

One useful way to frame this is through the lens of the **inner and outer loop**:

- The **inner loop** involves local development activities — writing code, running unit tests, debugging, and validating changes before pushing them.
- The **outer loop** begins after code is committed and includes CI/CD pipelines, integration testing, security scans, staging, production rollout, and feedback collection.

However, this lens is only the beginning. While it highlights where feedback slows down and friction emerges, the deeper story lies in what causes those inefficiencies to begin with — and why some teams struggle more than others.

## Multidimensional Friction

Throughout the software lifecycle, the whole organization encounter friction that stems from more than just tooling. The real challenges span multiple dimensions:

- **Tooling Friction**: Disconnected local and remote environments, incomplete dependency simulation, brittle CI pipelines.
- **Process Friction**: Legacy approval chains, inconsistent quality gates, and workflows misaligned with fast iteration.
- **Collaboration Friction**: Teams operating in silos, with limited visibility, unclear shared responsibilities and lack of understanding between developers and platform engineers.
- **Organizational Friction**: Resistance to change, skill gaps in cloud native practices, lack of leadership support, underfunded platform teams, and outdated operating models that constrain experimentation and learning.

Each of these friction points contributes to slow delivery, reduced developer confidence, and ultimately, an underwhelming return on cloud native investments. And as teams evolve, so do the types of friction they face — what blocks a beginner team may be entirely different from what slows down a more advanced one.

## The Missing Shared Structure

What’s often missing isn’t another tool, a shinier dashboard, or another best practice. It’s **shared structure**.

Cloud native development demands a new way of working — one that fosters alignment across platform teams, developers, and leadership. Without a common foundation, platforms become shelfware and feedback loops break down.

The **Cloud Native Adoption Framework** was developed to provide that structure. It’s a diagnostic lens, a collaboration tool, and a flexible roadmap all in one. It doesn’t aim to be prescriptive — it aims to offer language, clarity, and momentum.

The framework is built around four iterative stages:

1. **Envision and Challenge** – Define a bold target condition tied to business value.
2. **Align and Plan** – Map the current state and build a shared roadmap.
3. **Launch and Experiment** – Run targeted experiments and accelerate feedback.
4. **Optimize, Scale, and Evolve** – Institutionalize learning, improve resilience, and support continuous improvement.

Drawing inspiration from the Improvement Kata and cloud adoption frameworks, this model integrates technical, cultural, and organizational perspectives to support both new and mature teams.

## A Foundation for Collaboration

This framework is being offered to the community as a **starting point** — not a finished product. The intent is to enable richer conversations around DevX, platform engineering, and organizational readiness in the cloud native world.

If you’re working through similar challenges or want to contribute to shaping this initiative, your feedback and stories are welcome. This is the beginning of a shared journey — one that we hope will lead to better experiences for developers, stronger alignment across teams, and a more effective path to cloud native maturity.
