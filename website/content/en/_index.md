The TAG gathers feedback from cloud-native application developers, platform
engineers and end users; shares that feedback with projects in its domain; and
produces guidance and examples for end users.

The TAG supports projects related to its charter
such as those in the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode) under
[application definition and image build](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=application-definition-image-build&project=hosted),
[continuous integration and delivery](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=continuous-integration-delivery&project=hosted)
and [container registry](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=container-registry&project=hosted).

Today there are two active working groups under the TAG -
[WG Platforms](./wgs/platforms/) and [WG Artifacts](./wgs/artifacts/).
