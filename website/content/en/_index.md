The TAG gathers feedback from cloud-native application developers, platform
engineers and end users; shares that feedback with projects in its domain; and
produces guidance and examples for end users.

The TAG supports projects related to its charter
such as those in the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?view-mode=card) under
[application definition and image build](https://landscape.cncf.io/?view-mode=card#app-definition-and-development--application-definition-image-build),
[continuous integration and delivery](https://landscape.cncf.io/?view-mode=card#app-definition-and-development--continuous-integration-delivery)
and [container registry](https://landscape.cncf.io/?view-mode=card#provisioning--container-registry).

Today there are two active working groups under the TAG -
[WG Platforms](./wgs/platforms/) and [WG Artifacts](./wgs/artifacts/).
