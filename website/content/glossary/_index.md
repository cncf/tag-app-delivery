A **platform** aggregates capabilities to serve developers and operators in
development and delivery of products, services and apps. In reference to the
scenarios it aims to support, a platform may be named a "Developer Platform", a
"Delivery Platform", an "App Platform" or even a "Cloud Platform." The
connotations of the older term "Platform-as-a-Service", or PaaS, are also
influential.

**Platforms** enable developers and operators to deliver applications and
services faster by providing and managing common capabilities. Platforms bridge
between platform users and platform capability providers, and are built and
maintained by platform teams.

**Platform capability providers** develop and maintain the capabilities offered
by the platform. Providers can be both external organizations or internal teams,
and capabilities can be infrastructure, runtime, or other supporting services.

**Platform engineers** are responsible for developing and 
maintaining interfaces and tools to enable provisioning and integration of platform 
capabilities in applications, according to the requirements and instructions provided 
by platform product managers. Platform developers are usually grouped in platform teams.

**Platform product managers** are responsible for understanding the experience of
platform users, building a roadmap that addresses platform product gaps, requirements, 
and opportunities, and managing platform teams in their daily work.

**Platform teams** are responsible for developing and maintaining the interfaces to 
and experiences with platform capabilities - like Web portals, custom APIs, and 
golden path templates.  
Platform teams are managed by platform product managers and involve
platform developers. As the platform evolves and become more advanced, other roles 
can become part of a platform team, including, but not limited to, operators, 
QA analysts, UI/UX designers, technical writers, developer advocates.

**Platform users** include but aren't limited to app developers and operators, data
scientists, COTS software operators, and information workers - whoever runs
software on the platform or uses platform provided capabilities.

**Thinnest viable platform (TVP)** is a concept originally defined in the book *Team Topologies*
by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. The definition says: "A TVP is a careful balance between 
keeping the platform small and ensuring that the platform is helping to accelerate and simplify 
software delivery for teams building on the platform."
