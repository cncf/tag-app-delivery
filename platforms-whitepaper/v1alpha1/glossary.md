## Glossary

- A platform aggregates capabilities to serve developers and operators in development and delivery of products, services and apps. In reference to the scenarios it aims to support, a platform may be named a "Developer Platform", a "Delivery Platform", an "App Platform" or even a "Cloud Platform." The connotations of the older term "Platform-as-a-Service", or PaaS, are also influential.
- Platforms enable developers and operators to deliver applications and services faster by providing and managing common capabilities. Platforms bridge between platform users and platform capability providers.
- Platform users include but aren't limited to app developers and operators, data scientists, COTS software operators, and information workers - whoever runs software on the platform or uses platform provided capabilities.
- Platform capability providers implement infrastructure services, often as controllers and operators.
- Platform developers design interfaces and tools to enable provisioning and integration of platform capabilities in applications.
- Platform product managers are responsible for understanding the experience of platform users and building a roadmap that addresses platform product gaps and opportunities.
